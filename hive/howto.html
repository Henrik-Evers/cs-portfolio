        <h1>What I Created</h1>
        <a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>I created an artificial intelligence (AI) that competes with other AIs in a game called The Hive.</a>
        <hr>
        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>The AI is given information consisting of the map and the locations of all "bees" and their "hives". The AI then uses this information to decide which direction to move. It is up to the programmer to decide how the AI will process this information and makes decisions off of it.</a>
        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>For processing data, the AI has several groups that are used to process data and prepare it for processing.</a><br>
        <img src='resources/ogtalf.png' style='display:block; float:left;'><a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>It sets variable <code>x</code> to equal a random integer from 1 to 3 (inclusive) using my random function. Then, if <code>x == 2</code> is found to be true, the cell would be a forest. Otherwise, it would be sand. The new generator is quite different, as is needed.</a><br><br><br><br>
        <img src='resources/newtalf.png' style='display:block; float:right;'>
        <a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>First, it sets x to equal a random from 1 to 3, inclusive, similar to the first time. I used a ternary operator after so that if <code>x <= talf.value</code>, it sets x to true. Otherwise, x is unchanged. Then, in the switch statement, if <code>x == true</code>, then the block becomes forest. Otherwise, it is sand. So, if talf.value is 1 (the default), only x = 1 would make the pixel a forest. However, if talf.value is changed to 2, x = 2 would also make the pixel a forest.</a>

        <h1>How this Project Changed My Connection and Understanding of What it Means to Interact with Something</h1>
        <a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>This project allowed me to learn how to use ternary operators, and made me more proficient in JS DOM, which I already had some experience in. I learned about the select tag, and more types that can be used for input tags.</a>
        <hr>
        <h1>What I Would Change if I Had More Time</h1>
        <a><span style='color:transparent'>YEEET</span>If I had more time, I would have increased the amount of parameters that could be changed, and would have polished the generation so that it would produce more cohesive products.</a>
